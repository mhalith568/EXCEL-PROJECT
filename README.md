# EXCEL-PROJECT Healthcare-analysis
📊 Healthcare Data Analysis Using Microsoft Excel
📁 Project Overview

This project presents a complete data analysis of healthcare-related information using Microsoft Excel. The goal is to identify meaningful insights about patient demographics, hospital performance, treatment outcomes, and cost analysis.
The project demonstrates essential data analytics skills such as data cleaning, data transformation, dashboard creation, and insight generation using Excel formulas, pivot tables, and visualizations.

🎯 Objectives

Clean and prepare raw healthcare data for analysis

Analyze patient demographics and hospital utilization

Evaluate treatment outcomes and cost-related factors

Develop interactive Excel dashboards for stakeholders

Provide actionable insights to improve decision-making

🛠️ Data Cleaning & Preparation

Key steps performed:

Removed duplicate records

Filled or handled missing values

Standardized date formats and text fields

Created calculated columns (Age Group, Cost Category, Treatment Duration, etc.)

Validated fields for consistency (Gender, Patient IDs, Hospital Codes)

Excel Tools Used:
✓ Power Query
✓ Conditional Formatting
✓ Text Functions (LEFT, RIGHT, TRIM, PROPER)
✓ Date Functions (YEAR, MONTH, DATEDIF)
✓ Logical Functions (IF, AND, OR)

📈 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
🔹 1. Patient Demographics

Distribution by gender

Age group analysis

Regional or hospital-wise patient count

🔹 2. Hospital Performance

Number of admissions per hospital

Average treatment duration

Discharge rate comparison

🔹 3. Treatment Outcomes

Successful vs. unsuccessful treatments

Readmission rates

Most common illnesses & procedures

🔹 4. Cost Analysis

Average cost per treatment

Cost comparison by hospital

Cost category segmentation (Low, Medium, High)

📊 Visualizations & Dashboard

To make insights more understandable, multiple Excel charts were created:

Bar Charts – Patient distribution, hospital admissions

Pie Charts – Treatment success rate, gender ratio

Line Charts – Monthly patient trend

Pivot Tables – Cost analysis, demographic summaries

slicers & filters for interactive exploration

A single-page interactive Dashboard summarises:

Patient Summary

Hospital KPIs

Outcome Analysis

Cost Metrics

💡 Key Insights

Some major insights found in the analysis:

Hospitals with shorter treatment durations tend to have higher recovery rates

Patients aged 45+ contribute the highest percentage of hospital admissions

Certain hospitals show significantly higher treatment costs for the same procedures

The readmission rate is highest among chronic illness patients

(You can adjust these based on your actual findings.)
